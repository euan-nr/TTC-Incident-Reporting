# TTC-Incident-Reporting
A data analysis exercise taking open data from the TTC that takes a look at the delays that occur on Toronto's subway system

This project makes use of open data taken from https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/ , spanning a period of 2018-2023

So far we can visualise the stations with the most delay reports, as well as the stations with the highest aggregated waiting times over the course of the period studied.

Much to be done!
